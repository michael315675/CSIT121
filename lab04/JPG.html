    <p>This is a jpeg of a cat.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>A JPEG or Joint Photographic Expert Group image is good photography because of small file size while having good to decent picture quality.</li>
    <li>You can tell if its a jepg or not by the identifier at the end of the file name example .jpg or .jpeg.</li>
    <li>This file type is the most popular file type.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is a picture of cat I chose this image because the cat kind of reminds me of garfield. This picture also demonstrates why it is best for photos because of its small file size and good quality.</p>
