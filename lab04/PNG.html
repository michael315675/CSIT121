    <p>This is a picture of spongebob from the famous cartoon spongebob that first aired May 1, 1999 in the US.</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li>A PNG or Portable Network Graphics image is more percise than jepg and can change transparency.</li>
    <li>You can tell if its a png or not by the identifier at the end of the file name example .png.</li>
    <li>This file type has limited support.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>I picked this png of a spongebob because I enjoyed the show when I was younger and this picture shows the lessons taught in the module. The picture shows a variety of colors and is sharp without losing transparency</p>
