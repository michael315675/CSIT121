        <h4>Which CRAP Design Principle does the use? </h4>
        <p>It uses two CRAP design principles that being repetition and contrast. An example is the homepage where you can find a ton of the same uniform boxes of information. Lastly an example of contrast is the website itself having multiple different headers and sizes to help lead users eyes to where they need to go. </p>

        <h4>What is the site's efficiency? Can users can perform tasks quickly?</h4>
        <p>The site is kind of efficient users can preform tasks quick but the layout is a little wonky and can be disorienting. </p>
    </article>
    <article> 
        <h4>How is the engagement? Is it pleasant to use and appropriate for its industry/topic?</h4>
        <p>The site is engaging having tons of pictures and things that will appease to a NFL fan or Ravens fan. It is pleasant to use not slow or mindnumbing at times can be disorienting. It is appropriate for its industry having a similar layout to other NFL teams and talks strictly Baltimore Football.</p>
    </article>
    <article> 
        <h4>Name at least one recommendation to improve this website.</h4>
        <p>There are a couple of things the site can improve that being accessibility the audit I ran on the website says that it has multiple failing elements that affect blind,deaf, and sighted keyboard users. Lastly the website can improve on the usablity there is alot of empty space on the homepage and alot of clutter that can make things disorienting when opening the website.</p>
    </article>
    </main>
    <article>
    <h4>Overall</h4>
    <p>Lastly I think the site does what it needs to do it can be better but it is appropriate for an NFL website offering users multiple different things from buying tickets to finding out stuff from past games.</p>
    <p>Here is a picture of the website and the audit:</p>
