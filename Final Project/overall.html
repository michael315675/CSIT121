      <h1>Overall</h1>
      <p>Throughout the course, I gained a solid foundation in web development, improved my problem-solving skills, and learned to utilize various online resources effectively. When first starting out it was hard to get down all the new information, but with practice, I became more confident and skilled. Things that gave me trouble was just finding the best way to style and position elements on the page also adding accessibility features like media queries. Another was remembering all the different tags and attributes in HTML. But luckly, I was able to overcome it through resources like W3Schools and Mozilla.</p> 
      <p>What I loved about the course were the depth of projects and the different aspects that were covered in our modules. From the first module that covered the simple HTML structure to XML and the study Web Development today I enjoyed the amount of information provided through websites and videos. This was a great project to put all of the learning modules together to make a website. I feel well prepared for my future if I decide to continue in this field.</p>
