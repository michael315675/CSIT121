            <h4>How is the site organized?</h4>
            <p>The site is pretty well organized. It has a homepage followed by headers and uses links to get to other areas of the website.</p>

    <section>
        <h4>Overall</h4>
        <p>Lastly I think the site does what it needs to do; it can be better but it is appropriate for an NFL website offering users multiple different things from buying tickets to finding out stuff from past games.</p>
